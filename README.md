# 65 Days of DSA Learning in C++ (Summer Vacation Project)

This repository is dedicated to my **65-day journey** of consistently learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++** during my summer vacations. The goal of this project is to enhance my problem-solving abilities, develop a strong foundation in DSA concepts, and improve my coding skills by solving daily challenges.

## Overview

- **Duration**: 65 days (summer vacation)
- **Goal**: Solve a problem every day to improve understanding of various **DSA** topics, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Language**: All problems are solved using **C++**.
- **Learning Approach**: Daily commitment to problem-solving, reviewing solutions, and analyzing time and space complexities.
  
## Learning Plan

Each day, I aim to:
1. Solve a DSA problem from online platforms such as **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, or **HackerRank**.
2. Write a clean, well-commented **C++ solution**.
3. Analyze the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of the solution.
4. Summarize the key learning points and techniques in the **README** of each dayâ€™s solution.

### Topics Covered (by Day)

Over the course of 65 days, the following topics were explored:

1. **Arrays and Strings**  
   - Sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, sliding window, etc.
   
2. **Linked Lists**  
   - Singly and doubly linked lists, reversing a list, detecting cycles.
   
3. **Stacks and Queues**  
   - Implementing stacks and queues, balanced parentheses, etc.
   
4. **Trees**  
   - Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder).
   
5. **Graphs**  
   - Depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), shortest path algorithms.
   
6. **Dynamic Programming**  
   - Solving problems using DP, such as the Fibonacci series, knapsack problem, etc.
   
7. **Greedy Algorithms**  
   - Problem-solving strategies involving greedy approaches.
   
8. **Backtracking**  
   - Solving problems like N-Queens, permutation generation, etc.
